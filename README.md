# SynBio_Project

The code is dedicated for US Traffic Accidents dataset analysis, in which relationship between higher traffic accident Severity and weather conditions are determined. 

Most of the code is written in universal method - the only thing that is needed to apply is specific column name, after which output of wanted function/analysis/code is given.

PCA analysis code is uploaded as a separate file.

Initial report of analysis conducted by Emilis is uploaded in PDF
